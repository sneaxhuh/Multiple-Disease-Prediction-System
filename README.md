# Multi-disease-prediction-streamlit

This project is a web-based application built using Streamlit to predict multiple diseases like Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease. The system uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of the diseases based on input features from users.

# Introduction
The Multi-Disease Prediction System allows users to input relevant medical details and provides predictions for whether a person is likely to have diabetes, heart disease, or Parkinson's disease. The predictions are based on well-trained machine learning models that utilize historical medical data for training.

# Technologies Used
• Python: Main programming language.
• Streamlit: Used to create an interactive web interface.
• Scikit-Learn (sklearn): For building machine learning models.
• Pandas & Numpy: Data manipulation and analysis.
• Pickle: Model saving and loading.
• Matplotlib/Seaborn : For visualizations.

# Project Overview
This project provides predictions for three major diseases:

• Diabetes
• Heart Disease
• Parkinson's Disease
For each disease, a dedicated machine learning model was developed using historical datasets. These models predict the disease based on input features like age, glucose levels, blood pressure, and other medical data.

# Installation
Install the necessary libraries - streamlit, streamlit-option-menu, pickle5.
Run the app by - "streamlit run 'path_to_multi-disease-pred.py file'" in terminal.

# Screenshots
